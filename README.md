# JavaScript Homework - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Background
This repository was made to create a table dynamically based upon a [dataset provided](StarterCode/static/js/data.js). It allows users to filter the table data for specific values, using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js on our web pages.  Two different web pages were created with the below requirements. 

### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search 

* Use a date form in your HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.

### Level 2: Multiple Search Categories 

* Complete all of Level 1 criteria.

* Using multiple `input` tags and/or select dropdowns, write JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
